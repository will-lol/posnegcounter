# Positive, negative counter.
This project provides a visual representation of counting positive and negative things over 100 trials. This project is designed to aid buddies in the student2student reading program to more easily count and analyse the readers progress over the first 100 words. The website will automatically generate a result, either telling the buddy that the book is too hard, just right or too easy.

**Extremely specific use cases require extremely specific solutions!**
